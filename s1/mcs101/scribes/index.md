# Scribes for MCS-101 Algorithm Design

## Introduction
Scribes for MCS-101 are filed by date and can be located [here](https://github.com/samyakahuja/class/tree/master/s1/mcs101/scribes).

## Contribution
Fork [this](https://github.com/samyakahuja/class) repository and then modify the .tex file and generate the corresponding pdf file. After generating the pdf clean any other temporary files and then create a pull request

### Developement Environment

#### Installing Compiler and packages

I use [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) for compiling the LaTeX files. I recommend not just installing the TeX compiler, but
all the TeX packages.

For Debian-based distros (Ubuntu/Mint): `sudo apt-get install texlive-full`

For Arch-based distros (Manjaro/Antergos): `sudo pacman -S texlive-most texlive-lang`

For Windows: Go to [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/download) and download the NET installer( can be found under All Downloads)
since it has all the additional packages.

#### Compiling

You can just compile a .tex to .pdf by using `pdflatex __filename__` or automate it by using a plugin for your
preferred text editor, for example you can use [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) 
for VSCode.

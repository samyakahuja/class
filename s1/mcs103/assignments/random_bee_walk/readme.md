# Random Walker : Bee

## Files

Programming was done predominantly in javascript and to use
a graphics library [p5js](http://p5js.org/) (for interactive
experience) additional web files were generated. [__app.js__][app.js]
file includes all the relevant programming.

To launch the program just open the [__index.html__][index.html] 
file in a browser, preferably google chrome because of certain 
JavaScript Engine support issues.

The simulation is also hosted on github and with internet
access can be accessed [__here__][index.html].

## Design Decisions

To start with this problem is just a variant of the random
walker problem where the probability of moving in a certian
direction is 1/6 and the direction themselves are 6 which
are separated by 60-degree angles in a cartesian plane.

So problems that needed solving were
+ Creating a Mathematical Equation for moving to the next
position in the path.
+ Calculating the distance between the starting position
and the finishing position of the path.
+ Deciding on the way the problem needs to be solved, There
are two main methods:
    - Solving by the simulation method where multiple runs
    of the algorithm are done and then the expected values
    are calculated based on the data collected.
    - Solving by a purely mathematical approach where the 
    problem will be solved by using mathematical equations
    only.

### 1. Moving to the next position in the path.

First a random value from 0 to 5 is generated because in
a hexagonal grid there are 6 directions for a Walker to move.
Now we need to move to the next hexagon based on this random
variable. 

Mapping from this random variable to a change in 
the x and y location of the Walker can be done in two ways:
- Directly coding the changes in x and y using if-else
statements.
- Using cos and sin functions to move the Walker in a particular
direction.

I choose the second option just because it is more elegant and
shorter to write.

```javascript
let theta = (random_var * 60) + 30
this.x = this.x + 2 * this.radius * Math.cos(radians(theta))
this.y = this.y - 2 * this.radius * Math.sin(radians(theta))
```
The angle theta is computed by mulipying the random variable(
0-5) with 60 since vertices are 60-degree apart. Finally 30 is
added because we want to bisect the edge of the Hexagon in order
to get to the center of the next hexagon.

![Hexagon](https://samyakahuja.github.io/class/s1/mcs103/assignments/random_bee_walk/hexagon.png)

Here the x location is changed by 2 times the radius of a hexagon
(which is assumed to be equal to the distance between the center and
any vertex of the hexagon) in the direction of cos(theta). Similar
thing can be said for y location but one thing to be noted here is that
the y location is decremented instead of incrementing. This is because
of the way computers interpret coordinate axes, where it is inverted as
compared to normal coordinate axes we see everyday.


### 2. Calculating the Distance

Distance between the starting and the final positions in the path can
be calculated by using various methods but the method I choose is that
of Euclidean distance, which is the shortest distance between any 2 points
in Euclidean Space.

This gives an idea of displacement between the center of the starting
hexagon and the center of the finishing hexagon. The equation that I used
for calculating is: 

```javascript
let dist2Hex = bee.radius * cos(radians(30))
let distance = dist(bee.getX(), bee.getY(), w / 2, h / 2) / dist2Hex
```
Here _dist2Hex_ is the unit of measurement that I used which is equal to
the distance between the center of a hexagon and the point at which the
edge of the hexagon is bisected by the line joining the centers of 2
neighbouring hexagons.

The distance calculated originally was in terms of pixels and hence to
normalize it I divided it by the unit of measurement _dist2Hex_


### 3. Method of Computation

I took an iteration to be defined as a block that executes, during which
it goes from the starting state to the finishing state in a defined
number of steps all according to the constraints defined in the problem, 
and at the end appends the distance between the starting and final states
to a list.

This list gets populated during numerous iterations that are run. In my case
I did 1000 such iterations. During each iteration I incrementally updated the
mean and at the end of all iterations for a particular number of steps(like 16)
I calculated the standard deviation.

The same process was repeated for some other number of steps, say 64.

## Result and Analysis

Results obtained for paths of length 16 and 64 for any one generation were:

|Number of steps | Expected Value | Standard Deviation|
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
|      16        |      8.27      |       4.48        |
|      64        |      16.94     |       8.73        |


The standard deviation is too high for the solution to be called stable
